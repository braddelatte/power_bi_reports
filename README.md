Perfect — here’s a unified and professional **README** for your **`power_bi_reports`** repository.
It combines the style and structure from your previous README (for `example_company_report`) with the latest content for `example_stats_report`.
The tone is portfolio-ready but still reads like documentation a data professional would maintain internally.

## 📊 Overview

This repository, **`power_bi_reports`**, contains a collection of **Power BI example reports** demonstrating enterprise-grade analytics workflows using **SQL**, **Power Query (M)**, and **Power BI Desktop**.

Each report shows a different aspect of professional reporting:

* Integrating and cleaning data from multiple systems
* Applying SQL transformations and Power Query modeling
* Designing dashboards with interactivity, clarity, and scalability

All datasets have been **anonymized** for public sharing while retaining realistic structure and proportional integrity.

## 🧩 Example Reports

### 1. Example Company Report

**Focus:** Integration of multiple systems (SQL + Excel) into a unified data model.

This report demonstrates:

* Data cleaning and transformation through SQL and Power Query
* Enterprise data modeling for cross-system validation and summary reporting
* Dashboard layout and navigation best practices

**Sample Data:**

* `sample_data.xlsx` includes integrated and anonymized tables derived from SQL and DoD-system Excel exports.
* Tabs such as *Validity*, *SOH_SOO*, *Last Cost*, and *Awards* reflect real business reporting components.

**Key Skills Shown:**

* Advanced SQL query design and ETL logic
* Power Query transformations for joining and shaping data
* Dashboard interactivity and design consistency

### 2. Example Stats Report

**Focus:** SQL-driven analytical reporting using Power BI with anonymized financial data.

All datasets in this report originated from a **SQL Server database** and were exported into an Excel workbook for portability.

**Workbook:** `sample_data.xlsx`
**Sheets:**

* **Sales:** item-level transaction data (`SaleDate`, `SaleItem`, `ExtSalePrice`, `ExtCost`, `Vendor`)
* **Req:** requisition and quote data (`QuotePrice`, `ExtQuotePrice`, `Cost`, `ExtCost`, `DaysToQuote`)
* **Prog_Desc:** project metadata (`ProjectNum`, `Prog_Desc`, `ProjectDesc`)
* **Receivable:** invoice and receivable summaries (`ARAmt`, `Freight`, `depAmnt`)

**Key Skills Shown:**

* SQL extraction and transformation logic
* Power Query replication of SQL transformations
* Power BI modeling, DAX measures, and navigation design
