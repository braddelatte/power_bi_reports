## 📊 Overview  
This repository contains a **Power BI example report** showcasing how data from multiple systems can be integrated, cleaned, and modeled using **SQL** and **Power Query (M)**.  

The project demonstrates enterprise-level data design, where most transformations occur in SQL before visualization in Power BI.  
It highlights skills in **data modeling**, **ETL**, and **interactive dashboard development**.

---

## 🗂️ Data Sources  

### 1. SQL-Based Data  
Most datasets in this report originate from **SQL queries**, where transformations were completed before loading into Power BI.  
The following tabs in the report are sourced from SQL-based data (stored in `sample_data.xlsx`):

- **Validity**  
- **SOH_SOO**  
- **Last Cost**  
- **PO Count & RCVD**  
- **Discrepancy**  
- **Loss Breakdown**  
- **Awards**  
- **Awarded to Comp**  
- **Summary**

These datasets were originally generated through SQL scripts, then imported via Power Query connections.

---

### 2. Excel-Based Data (DoD Systems)  
Additional supporting datasets were sourced from **Excel exports** generated by various **Department of Defense (DoD)** systems.  
These were cleaned, merged, and standardized through Power Query before integration with the SQL-based data.

Examples include:  
- Equipment and catalog references  
- Supplier and contract data  
- Validation and tracking logs  

---

## 💾 Sample Data Replacement  
To make the report portable and lightweight, all data has been consolidated into:

> **`sample_data.xlsx`**

This file contains **final, cleaned, and joined tables** representing post-SQL and Power Query transformations.  
It now uses **anonymized values** for any dollar-related fields (costs, prices, totals, etc.) to protect proprietary information while keeping the structure intact.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. Power BI loads data from `sample_data.xlsx`.  
2. Queries, relationships, and calculations mirror real production logic.  
3. Visuals demonstrate integration of SQL and Excel-based data sources.  

> 💡 **Tip:** If viewing in **Power BI Desktop**, hold down **CTRL** while clicking navigation icons or buttons to interact with them.

---

## 🔐 Data Disclaimer  
While this report structure reflects real-world project design, **all monetary values have been anonymized**.  
No proprietary, confidential, or sensitive data is included.  
The data may appear structurally similar to actual datasets, but all dollar amounts have been altered while preserving realistic proportions.

---

## 🚀 Skills Demonstrated  
- Advanced SQL scripting and data transformation  
- Power Query (M) for ETL and data cleansing  
- Power BI data modeling and relationship management  
- DAX calculations and dynamic measures  
- Integration of SQL and Excel sources  
- Dashboard and visualization design for reporting and decision-making  

---

## 🧭 Getting Started  
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open the `.pbix` file in **Power BI Desktop**.  
3. Ensure `sample_data.xlsx` is in the same directory (or update the path in Power Query).  
4. Refresh the model to load the data.  
5. Hold **CTRL + Click** to interact with icons and buttons.

---

## 🖼️ Dashboard Assets  
An **`images/`** folder is included in this repository containing:  
- The **PowerPoint files** used to design the dashboard background layouts.  
- Design **tips and notes** for dashboard composition and Power BI theme consistency.  

These resources demonstrate the visual planning process behind the report and how layout, color, and spacing were considered to improve readability and usability.
